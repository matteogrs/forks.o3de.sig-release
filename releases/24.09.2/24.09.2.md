24.09.2 is a maintenance release to fix issues found in the 24.9.0 release. Primarily focused on performance optimizations and bug fixes. 

**General**

* Fixed slow helper icon rendering (FPS going from 60 to 3) in high densisty scenes. Turning on Icon helpers in the editor no longer has an appreciable impact on performance.
* Fixes and improve the built-in crash reporting dialog by replacing invalid MFC code with NativeUIRequests dialog. The MFC dialogs where compiling but never showing up as their resources IDS were never registered.
