## Impactful Changes

### Core Engine Libraries
The main engine libraries are refactored as described in the dedicated [Request for Comments (RFC)](https://github.com/o3de/sig-core/blob/main/rfcs/rfc-core-2025-04-20-shared-az-framework-libraries.md), but these changes should be totally transparent to your project and gem files. The most important advantages are:
- AzCore, AzFramework, and AzToolsFrameworks are now defined as shared libraries (DLLs) for non-monolithic builds. So instead of being purely static libraries that are linked into all modules individually (Tools, Editor, Gems) they will be sharing the same common library at runtime.
- O3DEKernel was a work-around for sharing O3DE environment variables across different modules that were defined in AzCore. Since AzCore is now shared as well, O3DEKernel is no longer needed.
- Debug Symbols for AzCore, AzFramework, and AzToolsFramework are no longer duplicated in each individual PDB / Debug symbols table for each module. They now only exist for their corresponding AZ library, which reduces the symbol file size total significantly.
- This also helps debugging in Linux, as every gem is loaded with their debug symbols individually. Now it is much less likely to run out of memory due to the debu symbols being loaded into memory.
- The total size of the built binaries dropped significantly. The overall saving is 54.50% on Windows and 72.31% on Linux.
- The installer packages reduced by 26% on Windows and by 40% on Linux.

Please refer to the above RFC for before/after comparisons and further technical details.

### Material Pipeline
The Material Pipeline has received several changes in order to enable for supporting multiple material types with Ray Tracing in a future release (see the [Request for Comments(RFC)](https://github.com/o3de/sig-graphics-audio/issues/152/) for further details).

If your project contains only `.material` asset files that rely upon the built-in material types (BasePBR, StandardPBR, etc.), this should have no impact on your files. It is required to ask the Asset Procesoor to reprocess all the material assets the first time that you open the project after upgrading to 25.10, in order to refresh its cache directory to match the latest changes.

In case you are using Material Canvas to author custom materials, their shader files have to be regenerated again. This process happens automatically when you open the desired custom material in the Graph Editor.

Instead, if you have implemented custom materials using shader files or custom material pipelines that use the existing materials, then there might be higher impacts on your files since some function definitions have been changed. In the following, you can find the most important ones, but please refer to the specific [PR 18392](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/18392), [PR 18549](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/18549), [PR 18739](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/18739) for further details. You can also use `StandardPBR_Defines.azsli`, `StandardPBR.azsli` together with `ForwardPass_StandardLighting.azsli` for guidance, or refer to the [dedicated documentation page)](https://docs.o3de.org/docs/atom-guide/dev-guide/materials/material-pipeline-material-shader-interface) for more details about the new interface.

#### Material Parameters
The material shader parameters are now encapsulated into a `MaterialParameters` struct, which is passed as an extra parameter in the function used by built-in material types. For example:
```cpp
VsOutput EvaluateVertexGeometry(VsInput IN, VsSystemValues SV);
```
turns into
```cpp
VsOutput EvaluateVertexGeometry(VsInput IN, VsSystemValues SV, const MaterialParameters params);
```

Accessing to material parameters now happens with this struct. For example:
```cpp
float2 baseColorUv = uvs[MaterialSrg::m_baseColorMapUvIndex];
```
will be
```cpp
float2 baseColorUv = uvs[params.m_baseColorMapUvIndex];
```

The struct cannot hold textures or samplers, so they are replaced by indices. New functions are provided to fetch them easily (from the bindless SRG, if supported. Otherwise, from a fixed-size array in the `MaterialSrg` struct). For example:
```cpp
real3 sampledColor = GetBaseColorInput(MaterialSrg::m_baseColorMap, MaterialSrg::m_sampler, baseColorUv, real3(MaterialSrg::m_baseColor.rgb), o_baseColor_useTexture, uvDxDy, customDerivatives);
```
turns into:
```cpp
real3 sampledColor ` GetBaseColorInput(GetMaterialTexture(params.m_baseColorMap), GetMaterialTextureSampler(), baseColorUv, real3(params.m_baseColor.rgb), o_baseColor_useTexture, uvDxDy, customDerivatives);
```

#### Material Definitions
The material definitions are splitted into two files (e.g. `StandardPBR.azsli` turns into `StandardPBR_Defines.azsli` and `StandardPBR.azsli`).
The shader template now looks roughly like this:
```cpp
#include MATERIAL_TYPE_DEFINES_AZSLI_FILE_PATH  // "StandardPBR_Defines.azsli", declare structs and defines

#include <ForwardPassVertexData.azsli>          // declare VsInput, VsOut and VsSystemValues
#include <ForwardPassPipelineCallbacks.azsli>   // provide callback functions that use VsSystemValues

#include MATERIAL_TYPE_AZSLI_FILE_PATH          // "StandardPBR.azsli", implement material functions

// Vertex and Pixel - Shader Functions
```

The `VsInput`, `VsOutput` and `VsSystemValues` structs are moved into the `ForwardPassVertexData.azsli`, reacting to defines from the material like `MATERIAL_USE_VERTEX0POSITION`. `ForwardPassPipelineCallback.azsli` contains functions that encapsulate access to SRG members (e.g. `GetObjectToWorldMatrix(VsSystemValues SV)`).

#### Light Evaluation
The light evaluation is now separated from the light assignment and shadow evaluation, making the former part of the materials and the rest part of the render pipeline. In the `LightingData` struct, the `LightinChannelMask` moves to the `Surface` stgructg, and the `tileIterator` moves to a separate parameter.

Then, the render pipeline is now responsible for light assignment and shadows, and the material for PBR light evaluation. The `EvaluateLighting` function moves from the material-specific `BasePBR_LightingEval.azsli` to the pipeline-provided `ForwardPassEvaluateLighting.azsli`, and uses material-provided `InitializeLightingData()` and `FinalizeLightingData()` functions.
The `ApplyPointLights()` functions moves from `PointLights.azsli` to `ForwardPassPointLights.azsli`, where it handles the light assignment. Moreover, the `ApplyPointLight()` function moves to `ForwardPassPointLights.azsli`, but now only handles the shadow evaluation. It delegates the remaining functionality to a `PointLightUtil` class, which does attenuation checks and provides at least an `Apply()` method.

The `PointLightUtil` class needs to be provided by the material, although a default PBR implementation for all supported light types is provided in `Atom/Features/PBR/Lights/Lights.azsli`. This implementation still use the `GetDiffuseLighting()` - `GetSpecularLighting()` functions that can separately be overloaded by the material.

### Ray Tracing RHI
Projects that use Ray Tracing RHI functions directy need to be updated to use the new structs that are introduced in [PR 18913](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/18913). An example of a potential upgrade is (e.g. `DiffuseProbeGridRayTracingPass`, a custom ray tracing pass which separate from `AZ::Render::RayTracingPass`).

```cpp
RHI::RayTracingPipelineStateDescriptor descriptor;
descriptor.Build()
  ->PipelineState(m_globalPipelineState.get())
  ->MaxPayloadSize(96)
  ->MaxAttributeSize(32)
  ->MaxRecursionDepth(MaxRecursionDepth)
  ->ShaderLibrary(rayGenerationShaderDescriptor)
    ->RayGenerationShaderName(Name("RayGen"))
  ->ShaderLibrary(missShaderDescriptor)
    ->MissShaderName(Name("Miss"))
  ->ShaderLibrary(closestHitShaderDescriptor)
    ->ClosestHitShaderName(Name("ClosestHit"))
  ->HitGroup(Name("HitGroup"))
    ->ClosestHitShaderName(Name("ClosestHit"))
```
turns into
```cpp
RHI::RayTracingPipelineStateDescriptor descriptor;
descriptor.m_pipelineState = m_globalPipelineState.get();
descriptor.m_configuration.m_maxPayloadSize = 96;
descriptor.m_configuration.m_maxAttributeSize = 32;
descriptor.m_configuration.m_maxRecursionDepth = MaxRecursionDepth;

descriptor.AddRayGenerationShaderLibrary(rayGenerationShaderDescriptor, Name("RayGen"));
descriptor.AddMissShaderLibrary(missShaderDescriptor, Name("Miss"));
descriptor.AddClosestHitShaderLibrary(closestHitShaderDescriptor, Name("ClosestHit"));

descriptor.AddHitGroup(Name("HitGroup"), Name("ClosestHit"));
```
